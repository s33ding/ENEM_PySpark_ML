Absolutely, selecting the right features (also known as columns in tabular data) for your machine learning model is a crucial step in the process of developing a predictive model. Feature selection techniques can help improve your model's performance by reducing overfitting, improving accuracy, and reducing training time. Here are some key concepts and methods to consider:

Domain Knowledge: Before applying any automatic feature selection method, it's important to use your domain knowledge to handpick what you think could be relevant features. For example, if you're trying to predict house prices, you know from domain knowledge that the size of the house, its location, and the number of rooms are probably important factors.

Correlation Matrix: Correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. For feature selection, it can help you figure out which features are correlated with your target variable (and thus likely important) and which features are correlated with each other (thus potentially redundant).

Univariate Selection: Univariate feature selection techniques examine each feature individually to determine the strength of the relationship of the feature with the response variable. These methods are simple to run and understand and are in general quite fast. Some common ones include chi-squared tests, ANOVA F-value method for regression tasks, and mutual information.

Recursive Feature Elimination: This is a type of wrapper feature selection method. This method works by recursively removing features and building a model on those features that remain, evaluating model accuracy, and iteratively pruning the least important features until a specified number of features remains. This approach can be computationally expensive.

L1 Regularization (Lasso): L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This can result in some coefficients to become zero, effectively eliminating the least important features. This approach is particularly useful for high-dimensional datasets.

Model Importance: Some models can provide an importance score for each feature, such as decision trees and random forests, which can be helpful to select features.

Boruta algorithm: Boruta is an all-relevant feature selection method, which means it tries to find all features carrying information usable for prediction, rather than finding a possibly compact set of features on which some classifier has a minimal error.

While these methods can guide you to an initial set of features, it's also important to use your judgment and iterate on your model. Different models may find different features important, and the importance of features can change as you add or remove other features.

Finally, keep in mind that you also have the option of creating your own features (feature engineering), which can sometimes improve model performance even more than feature selection.

Remember, feature selection is part science and part art. It involves a lot of trials and iterative processes. These methods provide a way to navigate the space, but they aren't infallible rules. It's best to understand your problem, your data, and the assumptions you're making. It's also important to verify your results and to be ready to iterate when things change or when you get new information.
