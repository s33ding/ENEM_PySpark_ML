Absolutely, here are a few books that have in-depth discussions about feature selection, as well as more general machine learning topics:

"Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models" by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson: This book covers feature engineering concepts in depth, providing the theory and strategy behind choosing the best features for your models. It covers many types of data, such as text, dates, and categorical data.

"Applied Predictive Modeling" by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson: Another book by Kuhn and Johnson, this one covers the overall process of developing predictive models, including feature selection. It's a great book to understand the complete process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman: This is a more theoretical book that covers a wide range of machine learning topics, including feature selection.

"Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili: While this book is more focused on the practical side, implementing models in Python, it does have good coverage of the theory as well, including feature selection.

"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron: This book has great practical coverage of machine learning topics. It discusses a variety of topics, including feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.

"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop: It's a classic in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. It offers a deep dive into the theoretical aspects of the subject.

Remember to supplement these books with academic papers, blogs, and tutorials you can find online for more specific use cases or new methods.
